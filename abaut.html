                 Coffeeroasters began its journey of exotic discovery <br>
                    in 1999, highlighting stories of coffee from around the <br>
                    world. We have since been dedicated to bring the perfect cup - from bean to brew - in every shipment.</p>

                    <h2>Our commitment</h2>
                    <br>
                    We’re built on a simple mission and a commitment to doing good along the way. We want to make it easy for you to discover and brew <br>
                     the world’s best coffee at home. It all starts at the source. <br>
                     To locate the specific lots we want to purchase, we travel nearlybr
                    <br> 60 days a year trying to understand the challenges and  <br>
                    initiatives, and invest in coffee plant science. Curating only the finest blends, we roast each lot to highlight <br>
                     tasting profiles distinctive to their native <br>
                    growing region.</p>

                <p class="whit">Although we work with growers who pay close attention to all stages of <br>
                     harvest and processing, we employ, on our end, <br>
                     a rigorous quality control program to <br>
                     avoid over-roasting or baking the coffee dry. <br>
                     Every bag of coffee is tagged with a roast date and batch number. <br>
                     Our goal is to roast consistent, user-friendly <br>
                     coffee, so that brewing is easy and enjoyable.</p>
